        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Truth or Dare is a Discord bot designed to make conversations with your friends more fun and more exciting. The bot has Truth or Dare questions, Never Have I Ever prompts, Would You Rather questions, and paranoia questions. Altogether, the bot has over 1500  questions available for you to answer. Add it to your own server and try it out for yourself!    
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;When I first started making this bot on my own, it was just supposed to be a crutch for me and my friends when we were bored and couldn't be bothered to make out own questions. When I added it to a larger server of friends, it became an instant hit, and I realized I had created a great bot. I kept working and adding new features, and finally, 3 months after the first idea ever passed through my head, the bot was verified on top.gg. 
        <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Within the first few days after listing, Truth or Dare already had joined almost 500 servers. That number grew to 1000, then multiple thousands, and kept growing faster asnd faster. Currently, the bot is in more than 10000 servers. I'm astonished more than 10000 servers full of people all enjoy using this bot, and I'm proud that I've been able to improve people's Discord experience. I look forward to letting the bot grow and improve in the coming days, months, and hopefully years.</p>
